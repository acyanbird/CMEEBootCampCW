# IC 25 CMEE Bootcamp Coursework Repository

This repository serves as a collection of all coursework completed for the bootcamp. All code, data files, and assignments from the course are included and have been organized into weekly directories.

## Structure
Each week's materials follow a consistent structure, containing `code`, `data`, and an empty results directory. The code directory holds all programs and scripts, while the data directory contains the files they use. A README file is also included to list and describe the function of each script.
