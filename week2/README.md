## This week we include [Biological Computing in Python](https://mulquabio.github.io/MQB/notebooks/Python.html)

For `MyExampleScript.py` this file defines a simple function named foo that calculates the square of any number passed to it. And show how to execute a code in one file.  
`cfexercises1.py` define several functions to do the calculation. Originally this program does not output anything. But after the modification, it is more module like. In the main function it will test foo using different number, and get the user input variables.   
`cfexercises2.py` also define functions to play with for and while loop. I explain every function inside the file. And all the function will run using given parameters.
