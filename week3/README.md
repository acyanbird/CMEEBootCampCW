## This week we include [Biological Computing in R](https://mulquabio.github.io/MQB/notebooks/R.html#)

### `basic_io.R`
This script demonstrates basic file input and output in R. It first reads data from a source CSV file, then shows how to write that data to a new file. Also shows how to modify the output by appending new rows or overwriting the file with different formatting options.

### `control_flow.R`
It shows fundamental control flow concepts. It shows how to use if-else statements to make decisions based on conditions, and how to use for and while loops to repeat actions. The examples cover iterating through a sequence of numbers and the elements of a vector.

### `boilerplate.R`
This file create a R function that takes two arguments, prints the data type of each, and then returns them combined into a single vector. After that it prints the answer.

### `R_conditionals.R`
This R script provides three simple functions to perform mathematical checks on numbers. The is.even function determines if a number is even or odd, is.power2 checks if it's a power of two, and is.prime tests whether a number is prime. Each function is defined and then demonstrated with a sample call.

### `TreeHeight.R`
