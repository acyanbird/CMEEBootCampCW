#1 
Using ls -sh instead of ls -s to output readable file size

#2
Using + will combine similar commands and execute them together. So instead of execute ls a; ls b;ls c, it will do ls a b c.

#3
find . -type f -print0 | xargs -0 ls -sh | sort -n | head -10

Using null instead of \n to seperate outputs, than transfer outputs as arguments (using xargs) into ls.
